# Technical Drawing and Electrical Schematics

[Versão Portuguesa](README.md)

This repository contains visual materials and a structured summary of the skills developed in two course units: **General / Technical Drawing (DG)** and **Electrical Equipment & Schematics (EEE)**. Its purpose is to document the concepts and skills acquired.

## Technical Drawing ("General Drawing")

The class focused on the **interpretation and production of technical drawings**, distinguishing them from artistic drawing, and covered **orthographic projections, sections (cuts), rapid freehand perspectives**, and **standardized dimensioning**. An initial exposure to **2D CAD software** introduced basic organization and preliminary parametric concepts.

Core skills included **3D‑to‑2D spatial visualization**, **technical sketching for communication**, **consistent application of graphical standards**, and **symbolic representation of building service networks** (HVAC, water, air) within an architectural context.

Topics covered: technical drawing standards, projections, cuts and sections, perspectives, dimensioning techniques and selection criteria, architectural/network symbolism, and an introduction to computer‑aided drafting (CAD).

## EEE (Electrical Equipment & Schematics)

This class emphasized the **interpretation, modification, and digitization of electrical schematics** (principle, multi‑line, and single‑line), introducing the use of **CAD / AutoCAD** and **standardized electrical symbols**. It covered **electrical installations, control and protection devices, motor power circuits, automation basics, and circuit simulation**.

Skills developed included **translation between multi‑line and single‑line diagrams**, **selection of suitable control and protection devices**, **interpretation of lighting and power circuits**, **design of signaling and interlocking schemes**, and **structuring motor starting circuits** while distinguishing power from control logic.

Topics covered: introduction to CAD, electrical symbols and standards, lighting and socket circuits, signaling, sensors, auxiliary contacts, interlocks and sequences, and motor power systems (contactors and starting methods).
